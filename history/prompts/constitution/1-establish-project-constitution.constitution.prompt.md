surface: agent
model: gemini-pro
feature: none
branch: master
user: Faraz
command: /sp.constitution Todo Full-Stack Web Application (Phase II)

Purpose 
This project is a Phase II Hackathon submission that transforms a console-based todo application into a modern, secure, multi-user full-stack web application using a strict spec-driven, agentic development workflow.

 Mandatory Development Workflow
This project MUST follow the Agentic Dev Stack workflow strictly:

Spec → Plan → Tasks → Implement

- No manual coding is allowed.
- All implementation must be generated by Gemini CLI using Spec-Kit Plus.
- Any change in behavior must be done by updating specs, not code.

 Allowed Technology Stack
Only the following technologies are allowed:

Frontend
- Next.js (App Router, latest stable)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Better Auth (for authentication)

 Backend
- Python FastAPI
- SQLModel ORM

 Database
- Neon Serverless PostgreSQL

Authentication
- Better Auth on frontend
- JWT-based authentication
- Shared secret between frontend and backend

 Disallowed Technologies 
The following are explicitly forbidden:
- Any additional authentication libraries
- Any additional ORMs
- Any state management libraries beyond React defaults
- Direct frontend-to-database access
- Session-based authentication on backend

 Security Principles
- All backend API endpoints must require JWT authentication.
- Backend must never trust frontend-provided user identifiers.
- User identity must be derived only from verified JWT tokens.
- Every data operation must be scoped to the authenticated user.

 Project Structure
This project must be organized as a monorepo with separate frontend and backend folders.
Specifications must live under the `/specs` directory and follow Spec-Kit Plus conventions.

 Implementation Authority
Gemini CLI is the sole authority allowed to generate or modify code.
The human developer is responsible only for:
- Writing and updating specifications
- Providing environment variables and secrets
- Reviewing generated output against specs

 Success Criteria 
The project is considered successful if:
- All features are implemented strictly according to specs
- User data is fully isolated
- No unauthorized access is possible
- The full workflow (spec → plan → tasks → implement) is clearly demonstrated
