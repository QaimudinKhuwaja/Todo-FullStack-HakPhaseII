# Security Policies

## Account Lockout Thresholds
- Placeholder for policies regarding account lockout after a certain number of failed login attempts (e.g., 5 failed attempts within 15 minutes).
- Considerations: Duration of lockout, notification to user, administrative unlock options.

## Rate Limiting Rules for Login Endpoints
- Placeholder for rate limiting strategies to prevent brute-force attacks and denial-of-service.
- Examples:
  - Limit login attempts from a single IP address to X requests per Y minutes.
  - Limit login attempts for a specific username to A requests per B minutes.

## Notes on Future Implementation for Enhanced Security
- Implement robust logging for all authentication-related events.
- Integrate with an intrusion detection system (IDS).
- Consider multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
- Regularly review and update security policies based on threat landscape.
